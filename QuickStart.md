## Subaccounts
Subaccounts are accounts for users/businesses directly managed by the Service Provider utilizing the solution. If you are a standalone business managing only your own internal team, There should only be a single relevant subaccount for your business. 
### Subaccount Deployment
Currently subaccounts are only deployable by the Senteon Interna team. Please reach out to Support@Senteon.co for a newly issued subaccount.  
In a future update, subaccounts will be directly deployable through command center.
