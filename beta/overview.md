# Senteon Overview

This page is dedicated to an overview of the purpose of Senteon and its intended benefits for our users. 

## Philosophy
The Senteon team strongly believes that cybersecurity should be built upon fundamentals that allow for a robust environment with properly hardened endpoints. The team found that there was a distinct lack of solutions tailored toward helping professionals create and maintain endpoint configurations in favor of solutions providing advanced endpoint detection and response and other reactive solutions. While effective on their own, reactive solutions only achieve full effectiveness in properly configured environments.

Senteon found that setting up and maintaining properly configured endpoints within a production environment was a multi-faceted issue. An organization often cannot simply enable a standard benchmark policy template as this typically will not account for the specific needs of their employees or their unique network architecture. This can cause a multitude of problems from a high stream of helpdesk tickets, to network authentication issues, to the denial of mission critical software.

As a result, security professionals are forced to test configurations in a lab environment before pushing changes out to active endpoints. This results in testing phases that can take weeks to months to provide adequate configuration baselines. Not only is this process highly technical and time intensive, but the resulting baselines often take additional time to deploy during an acceptable maintenence window. As endpoints are used, their configurations may drift due to a number of reasons such as application installations, helpdesk troubleshooting, shadow IT, or malicious activity. Security teams need to audit individual endpoints to get true visibility, and then manually adjust based on the findings. Without an automated solution, this means potential gaps in security between audit periods that can be taken advantage of.

## Methodology
Senteon helps to mitigate this issue for organizations by removing the need to test and analyze individual security settings in a lab environment. We provide a centralized console specifically targeted at security configuration management and its relation to compliance by managing and reporting on configuration drift and mis-alignments compared to industry best-practices. This is acomplished through a unique process developed by Senteon that analyzes the activity on individual endpoints and makes determinations on the effects a control will have on daily activity using this contextual information. 

In cases where Senteon cannot make a decision autonomously (e.g. password policy, organizational culture-reliant policies), supporting data is sent to Command Center, the central administraor console, to allow the user to make a determination of their own. This data includes context-specific data as well as educational information about the security setting, minimizing the need to lab and test the control separately. After setup, Senteon manages security settings on each endpoint and ensures that they do not become mis-aligned over time.

Once Senteon is fully setup and on your fleet of devices, we provide context on how compliant each endpoint is in regard to relevant industry benchmarks and regulatory frameworks.
