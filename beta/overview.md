The team found that there was a distinct lack of solutions tailored toward helping professionals create and maintain endpoint configurations in favor of solutions providing advanced endpoint detection and response and other reactive solutions. While effective on their own, reactive solutions only achieve full effectiveness in properly configured environments.  Senteon found that setting up and maintaining properly configured endpoints within a production environment was a multi-faceted issue. An organization often times cannot simply enable a standard configuration template as this typically will not account for the specific needs of their employees, which can cause a multitude of problems from a high strem of tickets to the helpdesk to the denial of mission critical software. For the same reason, an organization cannot simply implement a break fix methodology in their employee's endpoints. As a result, security professionals are forced to test and lab controls that they wish to implement in production. This results in testing phases that can take months to years to provide adequate configuration baselines. On the other hand, enabling pre-configured
