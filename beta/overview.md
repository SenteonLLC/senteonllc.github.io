# Senteon Overview

This page is dedicated to an overview of the purpose of Senteon and its intended benefits for our users. 

## Philosophy
The Senteon team strongly believes that cybersecurity should be built upon fundamentals that allow for a robust environment with properly hardened endpoints. The team found that there was a distinct lack of solutions tailored toward helping professionals create and maintain endpoint configurations in favor of solutions providing advanced endpoint detection and response and other reactive solutions. While effective on their own, reactive solutions only achieve full effectiveness in properly configured environments.

Senteon found that setting up and maintaining properly configured endpoints within a production environment was a multi-faceted issue. An organization often times cannot simply enable a standard configuration template as this typically will not account for the specific needs of their employees, which can cause a multitude of problems from a high strem of tickets to the helpdesk to the denial of mission critical software. For the same reason, an organization cannot simply implement a break fix methodology in their employee's endpoints. 

As a result, security professionals are forced to test and lab controls that they wish to implement in production. This results in testing phases that can take months to years to provide adequate configuration baselines. Not only is this process highly technical and extremely time extensive, the resulting baselines often take time to properly work into business environments and then require constant maintenance to ensure that they do not become mis-aligned over time. 

## Methodology
Senteon's solution helps to mitigate this issue for organizations by removing the need to lab and analyze individual configurations, providing a centralized console specifically targeted at policy management and relation to compliance, and by managing and reporting on configuration drifts and mis-alignments. The solution does so through a unique process developed by Senteon that analyzes the unique activity on an individual endpoint and makes determinations on the effects a control will have on the daily activity of an endpoint using this contextual information. 

In cases where the agent cannot make a decision autonomously, this data is sent to command center to allow the client to make a determination of their own. This data includes context-specific data as well as control specific data, removing the need to lab and test the control separately. After an endpoint is initialized, Senteon managed the configurations on each endpoint and ensures that they do not become mis-aligned over time.

Once the configurations are set up, Senteon provides context to the client on how compliant each endpoint is to relevant compliance and regulatory frameworks based on the endpoint's configuration set.
