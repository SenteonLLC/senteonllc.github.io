# Setting Controls

Once Command Center and the Senteon Agents are installed on their corresponding systems, controls can be applied through the Senteon Command Center dashboard. 
To do so:
- Log into Command Center with the account details provided
-  navigate to the `Account Manager` tab.
-  Select the relevant subaccount from the list provided and choose `Manage Account`. This will bring up a list of all the controls that will be applied to systems running a core agent with that subaccount ID. 
-  After verifying all of the controls, clicking the accept button will apply all of those controls to the relevant systems. 

Once controls have been verified, the subaccount dashboard can now be accessed through the `Manage Account` button. This page will allow you to view endpoints registered under that account as well as reset controls for all endpoints in that subaccount. More information on resetting can be found [here]().
