# Generating Reports

Reports can be generated from the primary dashboard or subaccount dashboard. 
Simply choose whether you would like a CSV or PDF style report, where the report should be generated, and what information you want on the report then select `Generate`. 

The resulting report should be output to the directory you selected or the logged in user's `Documents` directory by default.
