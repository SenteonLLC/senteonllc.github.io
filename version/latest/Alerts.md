# Alerts
Senteon generates alerts for a variety of different actions that Command Center and Senteon Agent can take. Alerts are divided into three priority levels:
* Critical
  * Critical alerts involve events that require immediate attention or action from the managing team.
* Important
  * Important alerts have middling severity level that typically indicates that there may not be action needed, but the team should be aware that the event has occurred.
* Informational
  * Informational alerts provide details to the activities and events occurring on the agents
