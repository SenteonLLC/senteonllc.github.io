# Generating Reports
Senteon Command Center allows you to generate PDF-based reports. These reports can be generated for an entire fleet of endpoints in a Managed Account, for specific groups, or for individual endpoints. By default, these reports are saved to the Windows "Documents" folder. When a report is generated, it will automatically be opened with the default PDF viewing application. 

# Managed Account Reports
Managed Account reports have three different options that can be included on the report. The first is a listing of all endpoints within the managed account divided by group with their current compliance percentages. The second is a listing of all available controls with descriptions and Senteon preferred controls. Finally, the last section details all alerts generated for that managed account in the last month.

Managed Account reports are generated from the dashboard of the managed account.

# Group Specific Settings
Group specific alerts will detail all of the endpoints, controls, and alerts specific to the group and all endpoints within that group. 

Group specific reports can be generated from the button located on the group's info page found by selecting "view" next to the relevant group. 
This can be found by navigating to the endpoints tab under a managed account
Selecting `Groups`
Selecting `View` on the group that you wish to generate a report on
Selecting `Generate Report`.
