# Report Generation
Senteon Command Center allows for the generation of PDF based reports. These reports can be generated for entire managed accounts or for singular groups. By default, these reports are saved into the local account's documents folder. 

## Managed Account Reports
Managed Account reports have three different options that can be included on the report. The first is a listing of all endpoints within the managed account divided by group with their current compliance percentages. The second is a listing of all available controls with descriptions and Senteon preferred controls. Finally, the last section details all alerts generated for that managed account in the last month.

Managed Account reports are generated from the dashboard of the managed account.

## Group Specific Settings
Group specific alerts will detail all of the endpoints, controls, and alerts specific to the group and all endpoints within that group. 

Group specific reports can be generated from the button located on the group's info page found by selecting "view" next to the relevant group.
