# Configuration Sets
Configuration sets are groups of settings defined by Senteon as required or important for endpoints to have enabled or managed to ensure a strong security posture. Without Senteon, these settings would typically be managed and controlled through the local Group Policy console on the endpoint. Senteon utilitizes these defined configuration sets by associating them with groups to ensure that all endpoints within a group all remain consistent with each other. 

## Setting Information
Every setting within a configuration set can be viewed to see the setting's GPO path as well as its underlying value (registry, auditpol, secpol, etc). Information panels also include descriptions that have an explanation of the setting, rationale for why it should be configured, the impact of configuring the control, and its default and preferred configuration values. Finally, any compliance or severity value will also be listed here.
